|**importId** | **String** | If specified, a new transaction will be assigned this &#x60;import_id&#x60; and considered \&quot;imported\&quot;.  We will also attempt to match this imported transaction to an existing \&quot;user-entered\&quot; transaction on the same account, with the same amount, and with a date +/-10 days from the imported transaction date.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Transactions imported through File Based Import or Direct Import (not through the API) are assigned an import_id in the format: &#39;YNAB:[milliunit_amount]:[iso_date]:[occurrence]&#39;. For example, a transaction dated 2015-12-30 in the amount of -$294.23 USD would have an import_id of &#39;YNAB:-294230:2015-12-30:1&#39;.  If a second transaction on the same account was imported and had the same date and same amount, its import_id would be &#39;YNAB:-294230:2015-12-30:2&#39;.  Using a consistent format will prevent duplicates through Direct Import and File Based Import.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If import_id is omitted or specified as null, the transaction will be treated as a \&quot;user-entered\&quot; transaction. As such, it will be eligible to be matched against transactions later being imported (via DI, FBI, or API). |  [optional] |
